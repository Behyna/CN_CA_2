===== TESTING REED-SOLOMON WITH CURRENT PARAMETERS =====

Original data size: 8192 bytes
ErrorCorrection: Encoding 8192 bytes with 120 bytes of Reed-Solomon redundancy
Reed-Solomon: Encoding 8192 bytes with t= 200
Reed-Solomon: Encoded 8192 bytes to 37995 bytes
ErrorCorrection: Encoded data size: 37995 bytes (original: 8192 + redundancy: 29803 )
Reed-Solomon encoded size: 37995 bytes
Reed-Solomon parameters: t= 200 , max correctable per block: 100 symbols = 800 bits
ErrorCorrection: Injecting noise with probability 0.01 into 303960 bits
ErrorCorrection: Injected 2995 bit errors (actual error rate: "0.985" %)
Injected 2995 bit errors (1% of 303960 bits)
ErrorCorrection: Attempting to decode and correct 37995 bytes
Reed-Solomon: Successfully decoded 37995 bytes to 8192 bytes
Reed-Solomon: Detected and corrected 2873 symbol errors
ErrorCorrection: Data corruption detected - 2873 bit errors detected, 2873 bit errors corrected
ErrorCorrection: Data successfully recovered from corruption
✅ Reed-Solomon SUCCESSFULLY recovered from 2995 bit errors!
Errors detected: 2873
Errors corrected: 2873
Data integrity: ✅ PERFECT

===== REED-SOLOMON PARAMETER TEST COMPLETED =====


===== TESTING ERROR CORRECTION SYSTEM =====

Original data: 204 bytes
ErrorCorrection: Encoding 204 bytes with 32 bytes of Reed-Solomon redundancy
Reed-Solomon: Encoding 204 bytes with t= 200
Reed-Solomon: Encoded 204 bytes to 1020 bytes
ErrorCorrection: Encoded data size: 1020 bytes (original: 204 + redundancy: 816 )
Reed-Solomon encoded: 1020 bytes
ErrorCorrection: Injecting noise with probability 0.0015 into 8160 bits
ErrorCorrection: Injected 15 bit errors (actual error rate: "0.184" %)
Transmission simulation: injected 15 bit errors
ErrorCorrection: Attempting to decode and correct 1020 bytes
Reed-Solomon: Successfully decoded 1020 bytes to 204 bytes
Reed-Solomon: Detected and corrected 15 symbol errors
ErrorCorrection: Data corruption detected - 15 bit errors detected, 15 bit errors corrected
ErrorCorrection: Data successfully recovered from corruption
✅ Reed-Solomon CORRECTION SUCCESSFUL!
Errors detected: 15
Errors corrected: 15
Data integrity: ✅ PERFECT
