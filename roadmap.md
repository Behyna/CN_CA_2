# Distributed File System Development Roadmap

Here's a step-by-step approach to developing your distributed file system project incrementally:

## Phase 1: Foundation and Basic Architecture (1-2 weeks)

1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Install Qt framework and required libraries
   - Set up schifra library for Reed-Solomon encoding
   - Create project structure

2. **Define Core Classes and Interfaces**
   ```cpp
   // Base classes for network components
   class Node {
     // Common functionality
   };
   
   class Manager : public Node {
     // Metadata management
   };
   
   class ChunkServer : public Node {
     // Chunk storage functionality
   };
   
   class Client : public Node {
     // User interaction and file operations
   };
   ```

3. **Implement Basic Network Communication**
   - Create simple UDP socket wrapper classes
   - Test basic message passing between applications

## Phase 2: Manager Node Implementation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Develop Metadata Management**
   - File tracking (name, size, chunk info)
   - Chunk-to-server mapping (implement binary tree structure)
   - Server availability tracking
   - Add ChunkServer ID assignment using BFS numbering
   - Implement binary tree structure for ChunkServer organization

2. **Implement Server Selection Algorithm**
   - DFS-based server selection algorithm
   - Load balancing logic

3. **Create Simple Test Client**
   - Test registration with manager
   - Verify metadata storage/retrieval

## Phase 3: Chunk Server Implementation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Build Chunk Storage Mechanism**
   - Local file storage organization
   - Chunk naming convention
   - Disk space management
   - Add chunk linking mechanism (next-chunk pointer storage)
   - Ensure directory naming follows required convention

2. **Implement Chunk Server Communication**
   - Register with Manager
   - Accept chunk storage requests
   - Forward chunk metadata

3. **Test Basic Storage Operations**
   - Verify chunk storage works properly
   - Test chunk server registration

## Phase 4: File Operations (2 weeks)

1. **File Splitting**
   - Implement chunk creation algorithm
   - Add metadata generation

2. **Storage Protocol**
   - Client-to-Manager communication
   - Client-to-ChunkServer communication
   - Sequential chunk storage process

3. **File Retrieval**
   - Request file by name from Manager
   - Implement sequential chunk fetching
   - File reassembly

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete file storage/retrieval cycle
   - Verify with different file types and sizes

## Phase 5: Error Correction (1-2 weeks)

1. **Noise Injection Mechanism**
   - Implement bit flipping with configurable probability
   - Create testing framework for corruption simulation

2. **Reed-Solomon Integration**
   - Add encoding during file splitting
   - Implement decoding during file retrieval
   - Test recovery capabilities

3. **Measure Error Correction Performance**
   - Calculate recovery rates
   - Document unrecoverable error scenarios

## Phase 6: Firewall Punching (1-2 weeks)

1. **Implement UDP Hole Punching**
   - Create connection establishment protocol
   - Implement P2P communication

2. **Test Across Network Boundaries**
   - Verify connectivity across different networks
   - Test with actual firewalls enabled

## Phase 7: UI and Integration (1-2 weeks)

1. **Develop Qt-based UI**
   - File upload/download interface
   - System monitoring dashboard
   - Configuration options

2. **Final Integration**
   - Connect all components
   - Comprehensive testing across multiple devices

## Suggested Design Patterns

1. **Manager Node Design**
   - Use Singleton pattern for the Manager
   - Observer pattern for status updates from chunk servers
   - Strategy pattern for different chunk allocation strategies

2. **Chunk Server Design**
   - State pattern for managing chunk server status
   - Chain of responsibility for chunk forwarding

3. **Client Design**
   - Command pattern for file operations
   - Proxy pattern for remote operations

4. **Overall System Architecture**
   ```
   ┌─────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
   │  Client │◄───►│  Manager  │◄───►│ ChunkServer │
   └─────────┘     └───────────┘     └─────────────┘
        │                                   ▲
        │                                   │
        └───────────────────────────────────┘
              (Direct communication for
               chunk transfer/retrieval)
   ```

5. **Network Protocol**
   - Use message types for different operations (STORE, RETRIEVE, REGISTER)
   - Include sequence numbers for tracking multi-part operations
   - Add checksum/hash for message integrity

This approach lets you build and test incrementally, with each phase building on the validated functionality of previous phases. I recommend implementing the simplest working solution first, then adding features like error correction and firewall punching once the basic system works.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this roadmap?
